But he kept pocketing/spending more than his share. Shortly before the assault LJJ announced his plans to take the troupe to work in another area (where predumably LJH wouldn't be able to profit from their bookings anymore). So LJH seized LJJ's troupe's opera trunks and wouldn't net LJJ take them away, and an angry LJJ talked a few of his employees/friends/etc. into breaking LJH's legs. Died of his injuries a few days after the beating.
